Happiness Tracker is a web app for keeping track of what factors affect how good a user's day is. After creating an account, a user can conveniantly
record data about their data using the default variables (weather, temperature & hours slept) as well as about custom variables they can create
(e.g. if they were active that day). As time goes by, a user will end up with a dataset that reflects how good their days are along with information
on factors that affect their days. Happiness Tracker will then do analyses of the user's dataset to give insight into what factors are important to a
user's happiness. E.g. a user may discover that weather is statistically significant to how good their day is, as they're always happiest on sunny days.
This is an important component of your project that many new developers often overlook.

## Tech Stack
Happiness Tracker is built using Django and data is stored in a MySQL database. Both the web app and the databse are hosted on a railway server.
