Happiness Tracker is a web app for keeping track of what factors affect how good a user's day is. After creating an account, a user can conveniantly
record data about their day using the default variables (weather, temperature & hours slept) as well as about custom variables they can create
(e.g. if they were active that day). As time goes by, a user will end up with a dataset that reflects how good their days are along with information
on factors that may affect their days. Happiness Tracker will then do analyses of the user's dataset to give insight into what factors are important to a
user's happiness. E.g. a user may discover that weather is statistically significant to how good their day is, as they're always happiest on sunny days.

The goal is to give users knowledge that will help them more often have great days!!

## Tech Stack
Happiness Tracker is built using Django and data is stored in a MySQL database. Both the web app and the databse are hosted on a railway server.
